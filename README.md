# Stock-Market-analysis-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-
Stock market or Share market is one of the most complicated and sophisticated way to do business. Small ownerships, brokerage corporations, banking sector, all depend on this very body to make revenue and divide risks; a very complicated model. However, this paper proposes to use machine learning algorithm to predict the future stock price for exchange by using open source libraries and preexisting algorithms to help make this unpredictable format of business a little more predictable. We shall see how this simple implementation will bring acceptable results. The outcome is completely based on numbers and assumes a lot of axioms that may or may not follow in the real world so as the time of prediction.

EXISTING SYSTEM:
Stock market as we know it is a very important trading platform which affects everyone at an individual and national level. The basic principle is quite simple Companies will list their shares in the companies as small commodities called Stocks. They do so in order to raise money for the firm. But we cannot predict the best fit for the future sales in a stock market so sometimes people loss their money and sometime they get more profits also.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
In our model we can predict the future sales based on past predictions of year by year and month by month. Now if we try to graph the stock exchange price over the time period (say 6 months), is it really hard to predict the next outcome on the graph but by using our proposed system we can easily plot a graph and see the analysis. 

ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
-	By use machine learning algorithm to predict the future stock price for exchange of stock and find the best fits.
-	We can see the last few year’s data and day to day changes so we can easily estimating the future sales.
